# iFrame Allow Fullscreen

This plugin for Omeka Classic 2.7+ unblocks the `allowfullscreen` attribute in `<iframe>` tags for filtered HTML input fields. It is a simple application of the [`html_purifier_config_setup`](https://omeka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Reference/filters/html_purifier_config_setup.html) filter.

## System Requirements
